Description
===========================================================
This project is the result of several years of work by various TAs at the Interdisciplinary Center
of Herzliyah, Israel. The project currently has two components:

1. Reflection - used to test API compliance. Purely academic applications.
2. I/O Redirection - used to script tests that use stdin, stdout.

Usage
===========================================================
The IOUtils and ReflectionUtils classes expose the public API of this project. See javadoc for more.
